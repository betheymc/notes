- #### Can we use Svlete with Django?

  - Vue seems to work with Django much easier than Svlete, reasoning for this is that I immediately found confirmation that they work together on Google search, defintiely hard to find out how to integrate Svelte and Django.
  - Since Vue integrates with Django (https://medium.com/swlh/using-vue-js-alongside-django-template-45cbe17b3646), and Vue and Svelte are very similar (https://www.vuemastery.com/blog/vue-vs-svelte-comparing-framework-internals/), maybe Svelte can be used with Django templates after all.

  - ##### Specifically, can Svelte work with Django templates?
      - theoretically, yes. Whether we will still be able to update Django templates dynamically without a code deploy is a different question, and remains to be seen.
