### Svelte initial thoughts:

- I like that it improves page load speed
	- Interesting issue about Svelte scaling and a crossover point as far as page load speed goes: https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/2546
- I really like that the page can be dynamically updated so easily
	
- Would/could we still use jQuery with it?

- Since Svelte is component-based and has the style, script, and html tags all in the same file, how would we separate the CSS from JS with templates and such?
- When comparing issues on Github, Svelte has about a third of the number of React or Vue, and about a sixth compared to Angular.
- When comparing Stack Overflow questions, Svelte has 2k, Vue has 80k, Angular has 256k, and React has 316k.
- According to Academind (popular dev Youtube channel), Svelte is popular but still immature, and there are not yet Svelte-specific positions. (as of 2019)
- Svelte has a way to do conditional statements, as well as Django templates. Which would we use in djgano templates / can they be used together?
- I like the idea of building specific components with it, and seeing how that works. Since it's a new smaller community and mostly a one man show, that way we can get a good idea of how it works in real coding projects. If it works well, we could use it for the whole website.
- Will we be using the same code for ARJ as for the future pando? We could build parts of ARJ with Svelte and then revert to Vue later if it is giving us problems.

#### Other:
- this is a super weird way of doing things: https://svelte.dev/tutorial/updating-arrays-and-objects
- this feels weird / I don't understand it: https://svelte.dev/tutorial/keyed-each-blocks

#### Continuation of Svelte thoughts:

- Since it is less used, it is more time-consuming to learn and use.
